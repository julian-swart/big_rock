### This is an exploratory data analysis on the Big Rock Blue Marlin Fishing Tournament that occurs in Morehead City, North Carolina each year in the beginning of June.

Details:

- The tournament ran for 6 days: Jun 10th, 2019 (Monday) - June 15th, 2019 (Saturday)

- Boats can choose 4 of the 6 days to fish

- Entry Fee is $25,000 to be entered into all categories (some boats don't enter into all categories)

- 184 sportfishing boats entered this year

- The prize money purse is a record high at $2.86 million!

- All categories include: Fabulous Fisherman (first blue marlin to be weighed over 500 lbs), heaviest blue marlin, heaviest dolphin, heaviest wahoo, heaviest tuna, and the billfish release daily/aggregate categories 


### What I want to explore is:

- Does boat size, boat brand, where the boat is from, or time of day affect the amount of billfish caught?
