## Exploratory Data Analysis: The Big Rock Blue Marlin Fishing Tournament - Years 2017-2022

### Overview

This project was born out a passion for fishing, a curiosity to learn web-scraping, and to have some fun visualizing data in R. The Big Rock is one of the largest competitive sportfishing tournaments in the world. It is held annually in the beginning of June and is based out of a small coastal town named Morehead City, North Carolina - about an hour from where I grew up. The ultimate goal of this tournament is to catch the heaviest Atlantic blue marlin, resulting in a large monetary top-prize range of 1-3.5 million dollars. Typically, about 150-300 boats compete for this prize each year.

### Data exploration interests:

- With the data I was able to collect through web scaping, I want to explore:

  - The most common boat brands and boat lengths.
  
  - Distribution of time of day when billfish are caught.

  - The relationship between boat size and amount of billfish caught.

  - The relationship bwetween boat brand and amount of billfish caught.

  - The relationship between the where the boat is from and amount of billfish caught.
  
  - Explore any temporal trends across the 6 years of data that I have collected. 

### Tournament context, if interested:

- The tournament is mainly focused on blue marlin, which can grow to weigh well over 1,000 pounds and measure up to 16 feet. The other species of billfish are much smaller and have to be released. 
  
- The tournament runs for 6 days. Boats choose 4 of the 6 days to fish.
  
- The term *boating*, *boated*, *land*, or *landed* means the crew of a boat was able to catch and bring aboard a blue marlin that they intend to weigh on land. The fish will only be boated if the crew believes it meets the 400 lb qualification (they make this decision by measuring its length and girth to calculate its approximate weight).
