### This is an exploratory data analysis on the Big Rock Blue Marlin Fishing Tournament that occurs in Morehead City, North Carolina each year in the beginning of June.

Details:

- The tournament ran for 6 days: Jun 10th, 2019 (Monday) - June 15th, 2019 (Saturday)

- Boats can choose 4 of the 6 days to fish

- Boats can only fish from 9AM - 3PM, except on Saturday it is from 8AM - 2PM

- The boats have to be within a certain boundary off of the North Carolina Coast and the Gulf Stream. (The winners have to complete a polyraph test)

- Entry Fee is $25,000 to be entered into all categories (some boats don't enter into all categories)

- 184 sportfishing boats entered this year

- The prize money purse is a record high at $2.86 million!

- All categories include: Fabulous Fisherman (first blue marlin to be weighed over 500 lbs), heaviest blue marlin, heaviest dolphin, heaviest wahoo, heaviest tuna, and the billfish release daily/aggregate categories 


### What I want to explore is:

- The relationship of boat size and amount of billfish caught
- The relationship of boat brand and amount of billfish caught
- The relationship of where the boat is from and amount of billfish caught
- Do the above relationships differ if the fish was released or killed? 
- Do the above relationships differ by the species of billfish? (blue marlin, white marlin, sailfish, spearfish)
- Distribution of time of day when billfish are caught
- Average time of fighting a fish 
- The businesses/job titles of the owners
