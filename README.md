# This is an exploratory data analysis on the Big Rock Blue Marlin Fishing Tournament that occurs in Morehead City, North Carolina each year in the beginning of June.
Details:
Entry Fee is $25,000 to be entered into all categories
184 sportfishing boats entered this year
The prize money purse is a record high at $2.86 million!
All categories includes Fabulous Fisherman (first blue marlin to be weighed over 500 lbs), biggest blue marlin, biggest dolphin, biggest wahoo, biggest tuna, and the billfish release daily and aggregate tournament
The tournament runs for 6 days, Monday - Saturday
Boats can choose 4 of the 6 days to fish
What I want to explore is:
Does boat size, boat brand, where the boat is from, or time of day affect the amount of billfish caught?
