### This is an exploratory data analysis on the Big Rock Blue Marlin Fishing Tournament that occurs in Morehead City, North Carolina each year in the beginning of June.

Details of the tournament:

- This is a competitive sportfishing tournament with the ultimate goal of catching the heaviest blue marlin.

- Participants also compete in other categories, such as releasing the most billfish (blue marlin, white marlin, sailfish, and spearfish) or weighing in the heaviest meat fish (wahoo, tuna, mahi mahi). I explain all of the lingo in the next section below. 

- Blue marlin can grow to weigh well over 1,000 pounds. This tournament is mainly about that species. The other species of billfish (white marlin, sailfish, spearfish) are much smaller and can only be released. 

- The tournament ran for 6 days: Jun 10th, 2019 (Monday) - June 15th, 2019 (Saturday).

- Boats can choose only 4 of the 6 days to fish.

- Boats can only fish from 9AM - 3PM, except on Saturday this changes to 8AM - 2PM

- The boats have to be within a certain boundary off of the North Carolina Coast. They typically fish in and around the Gulf Stream in hundreds to over a thousand feet of water. (The winners have to pass a polyraph test)

- Entry Fee this year was $25,000 to be entered into all categories (some boats don't enter into all categories).

- All categories include: Fabulous Fisherman (first blue marlin to be weighed over 500 lbs, which wins over $500,000), heaviest blue marlin (winner this year won $793,187), heaviest dolphin, heaviest wahoo, heaviest tuna, and the billfish release daily/aggregate categories.

- 184 sportfishing boats entered this year ranging from 26 feet long to 97 feet long. People that enter this tournament are generally well-off.  

- Boats have to radio-in and report any activity, like when they are hooked-up to a fish, lose a fish, release a fish, or boat a fish. If a fish is 'boated', this means there is a large blue marlin on the deck of the boat that they intend to weigh. 

- A blue marlin must be of a qualifying size of at least 400 pounds in order to count. If it is not at least 400 pounds, that boat is penalized $10,000. 

- There are rules for what kind of baits you can use as well as other rules that we won't go into detail about here. 

- The prize money purse this year was a record high at $2.86 million! (The economy is doing well in 2019 apparently)

### Lingo explained:

  - The term billfish refers to the characteristic of a long spear-like nose/upper-jaw (a bill) that these fish have. Even though they are not a threatened species by any means, they are relatively rare to catch, hard to catch, fight very hard, and jump a lot when caught. The challenge of catching them, the show they put on when caught, and the size and beauty of them are just a few reasons for the allure to the sport of billfish. 

  - The term meat fish refers to the fish having edible and delicious meat. These fish have no bills and are typically easier to catch, smaller, and are more abundant. However, they are still big fish (typically 10-100 pounds). Billfish are generally not thought of as good to eat. 

  - The term releasing or released means the fish was let go instead of killed because it was too small, or because it wasn't a blue marlin. You get points for releasing billfish and this years winner won $142,375 by doing that. 
  
  - The term hooked-up means a boat is activiely fighting a fish that just ate one of the baits in the water.
  
  - The term lost, or wrong species, means that the boat was fighting a fish, but it got off (it became un-hooked). 


### What I want to explore:

- The relationship of boat size and amount of billfish caught

- The relationship of boat brand and amount of billfish caught

- The relationship of where the boat is from and amount of billfish caught

- Do the above relationships differ if the fish was released or killed? 

- Do the above relationships differ by the species of billfish? (blue marlin, white marlin, sailfish, spearfish)

- Distribution of time of day when billfish are caught

- Average time of fighting a fish 

- The businesses/job titles of the owners
