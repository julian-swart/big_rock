## This is an exploratory data analysis on the Big Rock Blue Marlin Fishing Tournament that occurs in Morehead City, North Carolina each year in the beginning of June.

### Details of the tournament:

- The Big Rock is one of the world's largest competitive sportfishing tournaments.  The ultimate goal of this tournament is to catch the heaviest blue marlin.

- Participants also compete in other categories, such as releasing the most billfish (blue marlin, white marlin, sailfish, and spearfish) or weighing in the heaviest meat fish (wahoo, tuna, mahi mahi). I will explain all of the terminologoy in the next section. 

- The tournament is mainly focused on blue marlin, which can grow to weigh well over 1,000 pounds. The other species of billfish (white marlin, sailfish, spearfish) are much smaller and have to be released. 

- The entry fee this year was $25,000 to be entered into all categories (some boats don't enter into all categories).

- All categories include: 
  - Fabulous Fisherman: first blue marlin to be weighed over 500 lbs (winner receives over $500,000)
  - Heaviest blue marlin (this year's winner caught a tournament record-breaking 914 lb fish and received $793,187)
  - Heaviest dolphin, wahoo and tuna
  - Daily/aggregate billfish release: points are earned based on species

- This year's tournament ran for 6 days: June 10th, 2019 (Monday) - June 15th, 2019 (Saturday).  Boats choose 4 of the 6 days to fish.

- Boats can only fish from 9AM - 3PM, except on Saturday they can fish from 8AM - 2PM.

- The boats have to be within a certain boundary off of the North Carolina Coast. They typically fish 50 or more miles offshore around the Gulf Stream in hundreds to over a thousand feet of water.

- 184 sportfishing boats ranging from 26 to 97 feet long entered the tournament this year.

- Boats have to radio-in and report any activity, such as hooking-up to a fish, losing a fish, releasing a fish, or boating a fish. If a fish is 'boated', this means there is a large blue marlin on the deck of the boat that they intend to weigh. 

- A blue marlin must weigh at least 400 pounds in order to qualify. If the fish is brought to land and does not weigh at least 400 pounds, that boat is penalized $10,000. 

- There are many other rules that we won't go into detail about here (including acceptable baits and supplies, condition of the fish when weighing, etc). 

- The tournament is run on the honor system, and winners have to pass a polygraph test to ensure no rules were broken.

- The prize money purse this year was a record high at $2.86 million! (The economy is doing well in 2019 apparently)

### Terminology explained:

  - The term *billfish* refers to the characteristic of a long spear-like nose/upper-jaw (a bill) that these fish have. Even though they are not a threatened species by any means, they are relatively rare and difficult to catch, they fight very hard, and they jump a lot when caught. These challenging and exciting characteristics, along with the size and beauty of these fish are just a few reasons for the allure. Not to mention the enjoyment of being on the open ocean with the comforts of a deluxe sportfishing yacht. 

  - The term *meat fish* refers to the fish having edible and delicious meat. These fish have no bills and are typically smaller, more abundant, and easier to catch. However, they are still big fish (normally 10-100 pounds). Billfish are generally not thought of as good to eat. 

  - The term *releasing* or *released* means the fish was let go instead of brought to land because it was too small, or because it wasn't a blue marlin. Points are earned for releasing billfish (based on species).  This years Billfish Release winner received $142,375. 
  
  - The term *hooked-up* means a boat is actively fighting a fish that just ate one of the baits in the water.
  
  - The term *lost* means that the boat was fighting a fish, but the fish got off (it became un-hooked)
  
  - The term *wrong species* means the hooked-up fish that was caught or lost was not a qualifying species.

### Note:

- Unfortunately, these blue marlin have to be killed in order to be weighed on land. I don't have access to old data, but would guess an average of only 7 are weighed each year. These fish are plentiful in our oceans and their carcasses are donated to NC State University's Center for Marine Sciences and Technology for research. 

### What I want to explore in the data:

- The relationship of boat size and amount of billfish caught

- The relationship of boat brand and amount of billfish caught

- The relationship of the boat's port city and amount of billfish caught

- Do the above relationships differ if the fish was released or killed? 

- Do the above relationships differ by the species of billfish? (blue marlin, white marlin, sailfish, spearfish)

- Distribution of time of day when billfish are caught

- Average time fighting a fish 

- The businesses/job titles of the owners
